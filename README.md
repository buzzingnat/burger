# burger
A burger logger. Follows the MVC design pattern. Uses Node and MySQL to query and route data. Uses Handlebars to generate HTML. Has a custom ORM to connect the database with the model.

## Frameworks & Helpers
* [CSS: Kube](https://imperavi.com/kube/docs/quick-start/)
	- Note for later: not impressed.
* [HTML Templating: Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
* [Server Routing: Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)

## To-Do
1. ~Bug: Devouring burgers doesn't work - error with 'put' call~
2. ~Feature: display letters left in text input~
3. ~Feature: prevent text input greater than 45 characters~
